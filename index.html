          <h2>About Me </h2>
          <p>
            Growing up in east <em>Dallas</em> most of my life. I found a passion for computers at the age of 12.
            Everthing about the internet fascinated me. In school google was everything. Not because it was easy to look up answers,
            but because I had the ability to look up everything in my hand. Being a avid gamer is what really got me going. <br>
            Spending time with my friends only 
            made my interest more fun. We used to stay up late to look up mods for games on the pc. In highschool I joined a game programmign course. Now I am in a <strong>SMU</strong> bootcamp still at it with more to come.
